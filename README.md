This project involves building a Customer Support Chatbot that can answer questions, assist users, and provide instant 24/7 responses—similar to the virtual assistants used by platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Zomato. Using Dialogflow, I designed conversational flows with greetings, FAQs, and fallback responses to handle customer queries such as “Where is my order?”. The chatbot was tested within the Dialogflow web interface and can optionally be connected to a website or messaging apps (e.g., Telegram) for real-time interaction. This project demonstrates how AI-driven assistants improve customer experience, reduce support costs, and ensure scalable, automated engagement.
